# 🚀 C++ Prerequisites for DSA  

This repository contains **essential C++ concepts** that serve as prerequisites for learning **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**. It covers fundamental **data structures, sorting techniques, and core C++ programming concepts**, but does **not include DSA problems**.

## 🎯 Topics Covered  

### 🏗️ **C++ Fundamentals**  
✅ Data Types, Variables, and Operators  
✅ Loops and Conditional Statements  
✅ Functions (Pass by Value & Reference)  

### 🏛️ **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**  
🔹 Classes & Objects  
🔹 Inheritance & Polymorphism  
🔹 Encapsulation & Abstraction  

### 📦 **Standard Template Library (STL)**  
- **Containers:** Vectors, Sets, Maps, Stacks, Queues  
- **Algorithms:** Sorting, Searching  
- **Iterators & Custom Comparators**  

### 🔢 **Sorting & Searching Techniques**  
- Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort  
- Linear Search, Binary Search  

### ⚙️ **Memory Management in C++**  
- Pointers & References  
- Dynamic Memory Allocation (`new` and `delete`)
